      Mousepad is the default text editor for the Xfce Desktop Environment. It has been design to be a
      lightweight editor you would use for basic file editing. Therefore Mousepad starts quickly, but
      also has features like editing multiple documents, vertical selection, type-ahead search, full tab
      drag and drop and much more.
    </para>

    <para>
      Mousepad started as a fork of Leafpad to provide printing support using Xfprint, but as of version
      0.3 is has been completely rewritten to add support for tabs and DBus. Although the rewrite added
      a lot of new features, it is still as fast as the Leafpad based fork and therefore fits perfectly
      in the Xfce philosophy.

      <para>
        By defaul the window hides the tab labels unless more then one document has been opened. If you have
        more then one document opened, you can switch between then by clicking on the tab, use the
        <guimenuitem>go</guimenuitem> menu or press the key combination <keycap>Alt</keycap> with the tab number.
      </para>

      <para>
        When you have multiple files opened in one window, you detach a document by choosing
        <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Detach Tab</guimenuitem></menuchoice> or press
        <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>D</keycap></keycombo>. When Mousepad is compiled with Gtk+ 2.12,
        it is also possible to drag a tab and drop it on another location on the screen.
