    <para>
      Mousepad is the default text editor for the Xfce Desktop Environment. It has been design to be a
      lightweight editor you would use for basic file editing. Therefore Mousepad starts quickly, but
      also has features like editing multiple documents, vertical selection, type-ahead search, full tab
      drag and drop and much more.
    </para>

    <para>
      Mousepad started as a fork of Leafpad to provide printing support using Xfprint, but as of version
      0.3 is has been completely rewritten to add support for tabs and DBus. Although the rewrite added
      a lot of new features, it is still as fast as the Leafpad based fork and therefore fits perfectly
      in the Xfce philosophy.

    <sect2 id="editing-multiple-documents">
      <title>Editing Multiple Documents</title>

      <para>
        By defaul the window hides the tab labels unless more then one document has been opened. If you have
        more then one document opened, you can switch between then by clicking on the tab, use the
        <guimenuitem>go</guimenuitem> menu or press the key combination <keycap>Alt</keycap> with the tab number.
      </para>

      <para>
        When you have multiple files opened in one window, you detach a document by choosing
        <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Detach Tab</guimenuitem></menuchoice> or press
        <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>D</keycap></keycombo>. When Mousepad is compiled with Gtk+ 2.12,
        it is also possible to drag a tab and drop it on another location on the screen.
      </para>

  <sect1 id="multi-selection">
    <title>Multi Editing</title>

    <para>
      Mousepad supports multiple- and column-selections. You can start a column selection by pressing the <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
      key and starting a drag with your mouse. To add single words to the selection press <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> and double-click
      a word with the mouse pointer. As long as you press <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> you can add content to the selection.
    </para>

    <para>
      When you've created a multi-selection, it is possible to cut or copy this to the clipboard. When you start typing after a
      multi-selection, the selected content will be removed and the typed characters will appear in each selected part.
    </para>

    <para>
      It is also possible to use this for multi typing. When you press <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> and drag at the end of a couple of lines
      you will see blue retangles appear at the end of the lines. When you start typing the characters will be added to each selected
      line. You can add as much of these insert points as you want as long you don't select a whole character.

      Another useful key combination with multi typing is <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Backspace</keycap></keycombo>, this will
      also remove character left or the insert point, while <keycap>Backspace</keycap> only removes characters inside the selection.
