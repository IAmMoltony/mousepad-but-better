0.3.0
=====
- A complete rewrite of Mousepad. The code is now written in GOjects 
  where possible so we have a solid base for further development.
- Run multiple windows in one instance. We also invoke a running
  instance with DBus (optional), this is needed for tab DND between
  windows.
- Support for multiple tabs in one window.
- Load multiple files at once from both the open dialog and the command
  line.
- Type-ahead find and highlight feature like Firefox.
- Support for editable menu accelerators.
- Reimplemented recent file support. You can cleanup the Mousepad history
  and a file is removed from the history when Mousepad was unable to open
  it.
- Various hidden settings.
- Statusbar with cursor location and whether overwrite is actived.
- Mousepad depends on GTK+ 2.10.
- Save button is now default response in the dialog (Bug #2941).
- No font is set as long the user has not defined any (Bug #2720).
- No compiler warnings (Bug #1697).
- Windows geometry is now properly saved (Bug #2945).
- Hidden option to show to full path in the window title (Bug #2896).
- Basic command line options (Bug #2397).
- The MousepadPreferences object uses XfceRc for saving the 
  settings (Bug #2786).
- No crashes when there is no rc file (Bug #2784).
