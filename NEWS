For those switching from Leafpad, here is good readable description of the changes since Leafpad 0.7.9

First off, we've partially switched over to Xfce widgets. That means you get whatever file chooser is 
best for your version of GTK+.

We've made the config file follow the XDG standard. The laymen's version is that the config lives in 
~/.config/mousepad instead of cluttering up your home directory directly.

We also have printing support, which is nice. Previously Leafpad was only good as a viewer/editor. Now you 
can do pretty much all the basic text filey things. xfprint4, which is used to do the printing, can do pretty 
printing based on file type. Nice for printing out shell scripts or other structured text.

We have an optional debugging build as well.
