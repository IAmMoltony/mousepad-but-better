0.3.0
=====
Highlights:
    - A complete rewrite of Mousepad. The code is now written in GOjects
      where possible so we have a solid base for further development.
    - Run multiple windows in one instance. We also invoke a running
      instance with DBus (optional), this is needed for tab DND between
      windows.
    - Drag and Drop support for text inside a document, between tabs and
      between windows.  Also supports opening a file by dragging it into
      the window.
    - Support for multiple tabs in one window which are both reorderable
      and detachable.
    - Load multiple files at once from both the open dialog and the command
      line.
    - Type-ahead find and highlight feature like Firefox.
    - Support for editable menu accelerators.
    - Reimplemented recent file support. You can cleanup the Mousepad history
      and a file is removed from the history when Mousepad was unable to open
      it.
    - Syntax highlighting of many filetypes (including printing).
    - Various hidden settings.
    - Statusbar with filetype, cursor location and whether overwrite is
      actived.
    - Mousepad depends on GTK+ 2.20.

Bug fixes:
    - Save button is now default response in the dialog (Bug #2941).
    - No font is set as long the user has not defined any (Bug #2720).
    - No compiler warnings (Bug #1697).
    - Windows geometry is now properly saved (Bug #2945).
    - Hidden option to show the full path in the window title (Bug #2896).
    - Basic command line options (Bug #2397).
    - The MousepadPreferences object uses XfceRc for saving the
      settings (Bug #2786).
    - No segfault when there is no rc file (Bug #2784).
    - Support syntax highlighting using GtkSourceView (Bug #3228 & #5803).
    - Proper Drag and Drop support (Bug #2055).
    - Fix recent files support (Bug #5635, #3850 & #7890).
