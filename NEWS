  - Loading multiple files at once (in new tabs). Both multiple
    select in the open dialog and by using the command line is supported.
  - Hidden settings
    - Set the recent menu limit.
  - Support for editable menu accelerators.
  - Using MMAP for loading files.

Bug that can be closed:
  2941 - Save button is now default response in the dialog.
  2720 - No font is set as long the user doesn't defined any.
  1697 - No compiler warnings.
  2945 - Windows geometry is now properly saved.
  2896 - Hidden option to show to full path in the window title.
  2397 - Basic command line options.
  2786 - The MousepadPreferences object uses XfceRc for saving the settings.
  2784 - No crashes when there is no rc file.

Bug that won't be fixed:
  956  - Xfce About dialog. This allows us to depend on libxfcegui4 for one
         dialog, so we're not going to do that and use the Gtk about dialog.
