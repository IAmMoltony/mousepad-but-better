## What is it?

**Mousepad** is a simple text editor for the [Xfce](https://www.xfce.org) desktop environment.


## The Mousepad Mission

**Mousepad** aims to be an easy-to-use and fast editor. Our target is an
editor for quickly editing text files, not a development environment or an
editor with a huge bunch of plugins. On the other hand we try to use the latest
GTK features available, which means that if GTK adds something new in a major
release that is useful for the editor, we will likely bump the GTK dependency
and integrate this new feature in **Mousepad**.


## Required packages

Mousepad depends on the following packages:

* [GTK](https://www.gtk.org) >=3.20.0
* [GLib](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GLib) >=2.42.0
* [xfconf](https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/xfconf) >=4.12.0
* [GtkSourceView](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GtkSourceView) >=3.20

The following packages are optional:

* [D-BUS](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus) >=0.34 (strongly suggested)


## Installation

The file [INSTALL](INSTALL) contains generic installation instructions.
