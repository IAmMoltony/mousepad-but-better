	* mousepad/mousepad-undo.c: Don't store a string (or even
	  prepend it in a GString) when the user is inserting text.
	  This saves a whole bunch of relocations (Bug #2737). We also
	  flush the insert buffer after a redo and don't copy strings
	  when inverting a delete step. This should bring the memory
	  usage of the undo manager to a minimum.
	* TODO: Add some undo manager reminders.
	* mousepad/mousepad-window.c: Fix compiler warning when
	  debugging is enabled.
	* mousepad/mousepad-application.c: Change from append to
	  prepend.


2007-05-08	Nick Schermer <nick@xfce.org>
	* mousepad/mousepad-window.c: Rename function so it matches
	  the standard mousepad_window_* names.


2007-05-08	Nick Schermer <nick@xfce.org>
	* mousepad/mousepad-window.c: Open a new tab when the notebook
	  is double clicked. Also fix some indentation.


2007-05-01	Nick Schermer <nick@xfce.org>
	* configure.in.in: Don't break on a broken glibc.


2007-05-01	Nick Schermer <nick@xfce.org>
	* mousepad/mousepad-dbus-infos.xml, mousepad/mousepad-undo.c,
	  mousepad/mousepad-view.c: Fix some typos and replace tabs.


2007-05-01	Nick Schermer <nick@xfce.org>
	* mousepad/mousepad-{document,window}.c: Allow uri and tab
	  drops inside the textview widget.
	* mousepad/mousepad-window.c: Hide the searchbar when all the
	  tabs are closed and make sure nothing segfaults when no
	  active document is found.
	* mousepad/mousepad-window.c: Make sure the textview is
	  focused when a new document has been added.


2007-04-28	Nick Schermer <nick@xfce.org>
	* TODO: Removed the items I've fixed.
	* Changelog: Break after 70 characters.
	* mousepad/mousepad-{document,statusbar}.c: Hide the visible
	  event box window.
	* mousepad/mousepad-statusbar: The statusbar is now on top of
	  the Gtk statusbar.
	* mousepad/mousepad-window.c: Add support for dropping uris
	  in the main window. Droping in the textview doesn't work
	  yet.
	* mousepad/mousepad-window.c: Add tab dnd. This required some
	  function reordering, but in the end it was quite easy and
	  made the code more logical. I've also changed the window
	  behaviour: when you close all the tabs in a window, an empty
	  window is left. This is easier for tab dnd.
	* mousepad/mousepad-{application,window}.c: Beter handing of
	  application windows. Also added detachable tabs.
	* mousepad/mousepad-{properties,window}.c: The last settings
	  of line numbers and auto indent are now stored.
	* mousepad/mousepad-window.c: Beter locking of menu updates,
	  this avoids some unneeded menu updates and also made the
	  start time of Mousepad equal to Leafpad (and probably also
	  Mosuepad 0.2.x), which is quite nice since it supports a
	  whole bunch of extra features.
	* mousepad/mousepad-window.c: Removed the 'close all windows'
	  option from the menu and the code. Not need for a text
	  editor IMHO.


2007-04-21	Nick Schermer <nick@xfce.org>
	* TODO: Fix some typos and add some new ideas and reminders.


2007-04-20	Nick Schermer <nick@xfce.org>
	* TODO: Add some stuff.


2007-04-20	Nick Schermer <nick@xfce.org>
	* TODO, NEWS: Update and expand both documents.


2007-04-19	Erik Harrison <erikharrison@xfce.org>
	* mousepad/mousepad-search-bar.c, mousepad-window.c: Fix some
	  compiler warnings.


2007-04-12	Nick Schermer <nick@xfce.org>
	* mousepad/mousepad-undo.c: Improve the behavior of the undo
	  manager. It now merges multiple spaces, new lines are a
	  separate undo action and when you redo some steps and then
	  start editing again we append the redo-ed steps in reversed
	  order with an inverted action, so you can undo every thing
	  afterwards. This consumes a bit more memory compared to the
	  old behavior (which simply removed every redo-ed step), but
	  it's much more consistent.


2007-04-11	Nick Schermer <nick@xfce.org>
	* mousepad/mousepad-{window,view}.c: Fix some potential leaks,
	  I'm not really sure, but it doesn't hurt...


2007-04-11	Nick Schermer <nick@xfce.org>
	* mousepad/mousepad-statusbar.c: Destroy the tool items
	  together with the searchbar (memory leak from valgrind).


2007-04-11	Nick Schermer <nick@xfce.org>
	* mousepad/mousepad-{document,window,statusbar}: You can now
	  click the OVR text in the statusbar to toggle the overwrite
	  mode.
	* mousepad/mousepad-{document,window,undo}: Initial version
	  of an undo manager. Not finished yet.
	* mousepad/Makefile.am, mousepad/mousepad-csource.pl: Remove
	  my perl script because it has some problems.
	* Remove some empty object functions.


2007-04-06	Nick Schermer <nick@xfce.org>
	* mousepad/mousepad-document.c: Fix segfault from previous
	  commit.
	* mousepad/mousepad-document.c: Fix bug in searching
	  backwards, we have to jump one iter backwards before
	  searching, because we start with the character right from
	  the first iter. Also removed the equal check because it's
	  not needed and only causing problems with backwards
	  searching on the first character in the buffer.


2007-04-06	Nick Schermer <nick@xfce.org>
	* mousepad/mousepad-window.c: Fix opening recent files that
	  do not exist.
	* mousepad/mousepad-window.c, mousepad/mousepad-document.c:
	  Update the window title correctly and remove the unused
	  notify::title signals.


2007-04-06	Nick Schermer <nick@xfce.org>
	* mousepad/mousepad-document.c: Because we don't use invisible
	  characters in the text buffer, I was able to write a custom
	  iter search function that can search in both directions, can
	  be case insensitive, no string duplications and above all:
	  is't over 10x faster then the gtk version. This gives a nice
	  performance boost to the highlight function.
	* mousepad/mousepad-search-bar.c: Connected the last signals
	  and added a wrap around option to the search bar.


2007-04-05	Nick Schermer <nick@xfce.org>

	* mousepad/mousepad-document.c: Remove unused properties.
	* mousepad/mousepad-{exo,window,preoperties,search-bar}:
	  Remove the exo bindings, mousepad only depends on Gtk and
	  libxfce4util.
	* mousepad/mousepad-csource.pl: Perl script to generate the
	  menu code. This script also strips the code between the xml
	  blocks, so a minimal amount of text is added to the binary
	  (ie. it produces better code then exo-csource).


2007-04-04	Nick Schermer <nick@xfce.org>

	* po/: Update the POTFILES.in file and regenerate the pot
	  file.
	* mousepad/mousepad-document.c: Make the scroll offset
	  smaller, so the textview doesn't jump around while searching.
	* mousepad/mousepad-search-bar.c: Make sure the search signal
	  is send when the search field is empty after a backspace,
	  so no text is selected in the buffer.
	* Remove some leftover tabs.


2007-04-04	Nick Schermer <nick@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in: Mousepad does not depend on exo anymore.
	  Only when you run in maintainer-mode, exo-csource is required.
	* mousepad/mousepad-document.*: Renamed mousepad-screen to
	  mousepad-document.
	* mousepad/mousepad-{search-bar,document,window).*: Added
	  function for searching, including the type-ahead search bar.
	* mousepad/mousepad-statusbar.*: A custom statusbar suitable
	  for displaying the tooltips, overwrite/insert and the line-
	  and column-number.
	* mousepad/mousepad-exo.*: The exo-bindings so we don't depend
	  on exo anymore, although I want to get rid of all of them.
	* mousepad/mousepad-marshal.list: Custom marshal for sending
	  search signals.
	* mousepad/mousepad-types.h: Search types
	  (a mousepad-enum-types.{c,h} is generated during build).
	* Various performance improvements and code cleanups.


2007-03-03	Nick Schermer <nick@xfce.org>

	* mousepad/mousepad-dialogs.{c,h}: Add response actions for
	  Mousepad so it's easier to understand what happens.
	* mousepad/mousepad-window.c, * mousepad/mousepad-screen.{c,h}:
	  Basic support for document reloading.


2007-03-03	Nick Schermer <nick@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in, mousepad/Makefile.am: Remove the PCRE
	  dependency. I should have removed this earier after some
	  testing.


2007-03-03	Nick Schermer <nick@xfce.org>

	* mousepad/mousepad-dialogs.{c,h}: New file for the dialogs
	  so the mousepad-window file becomes more readable.
	* mousepad/mousepad-window.c: Split some function and reorder
	  them a bit.
	* mousepad/mousepad-window.c: The items in the go menu now
	  have the filename as statusbar tooltip.
	* mousepad/mousepad-window.c: Check if the file is externally
	  modified before writing. If it is, ask the user what to do.
	* mousepad/main.c, mousepad/mousepad-dbus.{c,h},
	  mousepad/mousepad-dbus-infos.xml: Support for terminating a
	  running mousepad instance (that is connected to dbus), using
	  mousepad -q.
	* mousepad/*: Add function destriptions for Erik (and others).


2007-02-18	Nick Schermer <nick@xfce.org>

	* mousepad/mousepad-window.c: Improve the menu tooltips.


2007-02-18	Nick Schermer <nick@xfce.org>

	* mousepad/mousepad-window.c: Prevent multiple recent- and
	  go-menu updates when multiple items are opened or the recent
	  history is cleared.


2007-02-18	Nick Schermer <nick@xfce.org>

	* TODO, mousepad/mousepad-window.c: Add option to the recent
	  menu to clear the history.
	* mousepad/mousepad-window.c: The recent items are now in the
	  Mousepad group so it's easier to filter them when removing.
	  The list is also sorted by the most recently used item.
	* mousepad/mousepad-window.c: Fix problem in checking if the
	  file was already openened.
	* mousepad/mousepad-window.c: You can now reorder tabs.
	* mousepad/mousepad-window.c: A tab is now inserted right from
	  the current active tab.
	* mousepad/mousepad-screen.c: Untitled documents now have a
	  number like "Untitled #". The number is increased as long
	  as the application is running.
	* mousepad/mousepad-window.c: Added first parts of code for a
	  statusbar.

2007-02-17	Nick Schermer <nick@xfce.org>

	* TODO: Remind myself to fix problems with UTF-8 filenames.
	* mousepad/mousepad-window.c: Fix crash when opening files
	  with the command line.
	* Mousepad.desktop.in.in, Mousepad.desktop.in.in: Mousepad
	  executable is now lowercase again.
	* mousepad/mousepad-screen.c: Remove unused signals from the
	   Class.

2007-02-17	Nick Schermer <nick@xfce.org>

	* TODO, NEWS: Update the current status of the rewrite.
	* Mousepad.desktop.in.in: Add MimeType and improve Categories.

2007-02-17	Nick Schermer <nick@xfce.org>

	* Initial import of my Mousepad rewrite.
