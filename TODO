- Interface
  - Dialog when closing multiple (modified) tabs.
  - Tab font color when the file is modified or readonly.
  - Test the application with a screen reader and add Atk objects
    where needed.

- Text View
  - Search and Replace. Maybe also text highlighting.
  - GObject for undo/redo that is used by MousepadView.
  - Support for encoding.

- Saving and loading
  - Save All option.
  - Filenames and UTF-8.
  - Reload option. Maybe also stat the source file when switching
    tabs and tell the user if the source was modified.

- Other
  - Implement Gtk print support.
  - Maybe add support for gtksourceview and/or gtkspell (not a priority).

- Testing
  - Profiling the startup time.
  - Profiling loading large files (Gtk has a problem here). This also
    locks some dialogs.
  - Checking for memory leaks.
