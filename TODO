All the items below, except those under the feature heading, must
be fixed (or ignored when irrelevant) before the nick_0_3 branch
can move to trunk. When the branch enters trunk, it's important
we work towards a stable version, so we can release a 0.2.90.1
(0.3 beta 1) version as soon as possible (if needed, independent
from the Xfce schedule).


Interface
=========
- Tab font color when the file is modified or read only.
- Test the application with a screen reader and add Atk objects
  where needed.
- Cleanup the menus and make them consistent. For example: we're
  using both file and document atm. The name of the Go menu should
  also be changed to something more descriptive.
- Make the mnemonic's consistent all over the application and make
  sure they don't conflict inside a dialog/window.
- Check the search and replace code for bugs.
- Add option to disable the search feedback in the replace dialog
  (highlight, count matches, type-ahead). This can slow down mousepad
  with large text files.


Undo
====
- Need to fix a couple of issues here. I'm not really satisfied with
  it right now.


Code
====
- Check for code duplication and make sure the comments are worth
  reading.


Saving and loading
==================
- Save All option.
- Check if the file is externally modified when switching tabs.
- Cleanup and improve encoding support and order the encoding types.


Other
=====
- We need a cool Mousepad logo.
- Write documentation.
- Session manager support.


Testing and polishing
=====================
- Profiling the startup time. We can possibly use Frederico's trick
  to optimize the startup time:
  http://primates.ximian.com/~federico/news-2006-03.html#09
- Profiling loading large files (Gtk/Pango has a problem here). This
  also locks some dialogs.
- Checking for memory leaks.
- Make sure objects are unrefed when their parent is destroyed, Gtk+
  does not always take care of this.


Feature
=======
- Maybe a plugin based system for syntax highlighting and GtkSpell.
  We cannot use GtkSourceView with this implementation, because it
  cannot attach to an existing textview (GtkSpell can).
